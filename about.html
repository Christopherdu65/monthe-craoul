		<p>Hi, I'm Monthe Y. Christopher Raoul, and I'm a computer science student at Montgomery college transferring to a four-year univeristy after spring 2020. Growing up, I really liked biology especially during highschool where I learned genetics. I also liked mathematics and logics, and naturally going into college I had to make a choice between those two, and I ended up choosing mathematics by doing computer science. I intend to double major in mathematics and computer science once I'm in four-year university<br><br>I am currently looking for an intership in computer science for the summer of 2020.</p>
